# Repository overview

## Google Drive Data
Most data are currently stored in a Google Shared Drive. For each site, each batch of data (all point counts in a single day, or all arthropod surveys from a "round" of sampling) goes into a separate Google Sheet (copied & renamed from a template sheet set up for data entry). 

Scans of data sheets (or field notebook pages) should also go into `scans` subfolders.

Shared drive: `Cheadle Center Restoration Research Projects/Riparian birds and arthropods/data` 

Subfolders are currently as follows:

- `point_counts` 
- `arthropod_surveys`
- `survey_trees`

The script(s) in the code folder of this GitHub repository import data from Google Sheets using the googlesheets4 package or the googledrive package for csv or Excel files.
